# SidePolesDetection Project

## Overview

The SidePolesDetection project is a Java-based application that utilizes the OpenCV library for detecting side poles in images. This project aims to provide a robust solution for identifying and analyzing side poles in various scenarios, such as in road scenes or industrial environments.

## Features

- **Side Pole Detection:** Utilizing OpenCV algorithms, the application can identify and locate side poles in images.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Users can adjust parameters to fine-tune the detection process, ensuring flexibility for different scenarios.
- **Visual Feedback:** The application provides visual feedback by highlighting detected side poles in the input images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- OpenCV library for Java

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SidePolesDetection.git

2. Set up OpenCV in your Java project. You can refer to the OpenCV Java Tutorials for guidance.

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   Step 1 -> cd SidePolesDetection
   Step 2 -> javac -cp path/to/opencv-<version>.jar SidePolesDetection.java
  
### Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Load an image containing side poles.
3. Adjust detection parameters if needed.
4. Click the "Detect" button to start the side pole detection process.
5. View the output with highlighted side poles.
